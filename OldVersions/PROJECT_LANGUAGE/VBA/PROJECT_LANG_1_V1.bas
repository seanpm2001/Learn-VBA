' About:
' I decided to make VBA the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-VBA) as VBA is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the VBA programming language. It only makes sense to make VBA the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
